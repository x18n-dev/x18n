# x18n plans

x18n is a tool for viewing and maintaining the i18n files of any project, by humans and by agents. Its language server follows the LSP standard, and VS Code is the supported editor for 1.0. It takes the ideas of [i18n-ally](https://github.com/lokalise/i18n-ally) and rebuilds them as layers:

```
@x18n/core  ->  x18n (CLI)  ->  @x18n/lsp  ->  x18n-vscode
     \______________ @x18n/ui (devframe) ______________/
```

These documents are the plan. Each document owns one area. Where code and plan disagree after implementation, the code and its tests win, and the plan gets fixed or the finished section gets removed.
